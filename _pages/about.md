I am a first-year master student from [School of Information and Software Engineering](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/) (SISE), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC). I received the B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from the same institution.

My academic journey has been shaped by a profound interest in cutting-edge areas such as searchable public-key encryption, homomorphic encryption, and cryptographic primitives. These captivating subjects have fueled my passion for exploring the realms of information security and privacy. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yongjian Liao](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1036/5672.htm) of Spatial and Security Lab from [SISE](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/) at UESTC.
